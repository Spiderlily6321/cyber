3️⃣ Select the Disk
At the top-right corner, select the disk (e.g., /dev/sda) you want to manage.

4️⃣ Shrink Existing Partition
Right-click on the partition you want to shrink (e.g., root or home).

Select Resize/Move.

In the dialog box, enter how much space you want to shrink.

Click Resize/Move.

You’ll now see Unallocated space.

5️⃣ Create New Partition
Right-click on the Unallocated space.
